## 💡 Inspiration
Lung cancer is the 2nd most common cancer worldwide. It is the most common cancer in men and the 2nd most common cancer in women,
with more than 2.2 million new cases in 2020. It remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths. 

To help a little bit from our side our team brainstormed and came up with **Lung'sClinic**  where users can predict lung cancer by uploading the required CT Scan. Currently, the FDA has approved several AI programs in CXR and chest CT reading, which enables AI systems to take part in lung cancer detection.  We also have provided secure user auth.

## 💻 What it does
- Secure user authentication
- prediction of lung cancer.
## ⚙️ How we built it

- DeSo: For user authentication
- React Js: For frontend
- Coil: For monetization
- Google Techable Machine: For traniing the ML model

## 💲 Best Web Monetization Project by Coil

Additionally, we employ Coil to develop micropayment donations for helping those in need. You can monetise your website for a little price using the free, open-source, and open-source-compliant web monetization platform known as The coil.

## 🔐 Best DeSO Hack

To provide a secure user authentication, we use DeSo. DeSo is the first Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for decentralised social media applications.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project was challenging because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
- It was my first time learning how to use DeSo with Frontend and making a secure authentication.
- It was my first time using Coil for web monetization.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud of the fact that we were able to complete the project in the given time.
- We are proud of the fact that we were able to train our custom ML Model.

## 📖 What we learned

- How to make a secure authentication using DeSo.
- How to use Coil for web monetization.

## 🚀 What's next for lung'sClinic

- Building a mobile app.
- Training the ML model with more data.
- Adding more features.
